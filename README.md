## React Lyrics Finder Frontend

This app will first prompt the user for Spotify Authentication, for as far as I know,
it only works for Premium users. and this is what I use it for.
It will then get the user's current song playing and fetch it's lyrics.

I will add further information about setting up the authentication server in the future.
